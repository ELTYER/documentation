# Overview
The documents found on this page inform you of the state of the documentation.
Here an overview can be found on what we are currently working on and features 
planned for future releases.

If you want to start contributing to the Investing Algorithm Framework Documentation, 
make sure to read first the general development documentation to get an overview of the rules 
for contributing and all the procedures.


## Contributing to the roadmap
If you would like to contribute to the planned roadmap, first take a look at the roadmap page and check which
current version is released. This tells you what is already done and what we are currently working on.
Make sure to check also the changelog, to get a precise overview of the changes and progress in the planned
features.

If you have selected a feature that you want to work on, make sure that before you begin, you tell on [slack] 
what you are intending to do. Then some developers that are also working on the feature can help you and tell you what is already done and what still needs to be done.

## Merging your own work
If you made your own fork with features that were not listed on the roadmap and you wish to merge them. 
Please first inform the core team at [slack]. Tell here what you have done and why this feature is important. We will then plan with you the merging of your work with the framework.
