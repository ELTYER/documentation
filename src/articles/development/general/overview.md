# Overview

This development pages serve as reference points for developing against Investing Algorithm Framework and the 
Investing Algorithm Framework Documentation website, as well as finer details about running the Framework services.


## Getting Started
A part of every development project (especially Open Source projects) is documentation 
that explains how it works. Investing Algorithm Framework is not any different. Because documentation is a big part of 
what makes the Framework work weâ€™ve outlined some guidelines about 
how this documentation is structured and how to extend it.

We recommend going through the general documentation before contributing a change.

Further, if you want to have specific details about the development roadmap check out the Development tab.
If you want to have specific architecture details about the framework visit the Framework tab.
